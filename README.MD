# 24-2_DS_assignment - Week 1
## Assignment Title: Asset Price and Direction Prediction via Deep 2D Transformer and Convolutional Neural Networks
This is the first-week assignment for the YBIGTA Data Science session (24-2 semester). The assignment focuses on handling time-series data for asset price and direction prediction using Vision Transformers (ViT) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## Objectives:
Learn how to preprocess and handle time-series data for financial asset prediction.
Implement Vision Transformer (ViT) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the prediction of asset prices and their direction.
Understand the architecture of both ViT and CNN models and how they can be applied to time-series data.
